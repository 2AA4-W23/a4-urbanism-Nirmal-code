## How to run the product

_This section needs to be edited to reflect how the user can interact with thefeature released in your project_

### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run:

```
mosser@azrael A2 % mvn install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, and a file named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one. 

### Generator

To run the generator, go to the `generator` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. Sample.mesh is the binary file containing the mesh.

#### Grid-Based Mesh
```
cd generator 
java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh -grid [-width] [-height]
ls -lh sample.mesh
```
`width` and `height` default is 500px and are optional to change in the command line. 

Example: `java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh -grid -width 400 -height 400`

#### Irregular Mesh
```
cd generator 
java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh -irregular -numPoly [-width]  [-height] [-relation]
ls -lh sample.mesh
```
`numPoly` is the number of polygons to generate on the mesh.\
`width` and `height` default is 500px and are optional to change in the command line. \
`relation` default is 1 and value can be changed for any values greater than 1 to smooth the mesh.

Example: `java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh -irregular -numPoly 500 -width 600 -height 600 -relation 3`

### Visualizer

To visualize an existing mesh, go the the `visualizer` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product takes in the file containing the mesh, and the name of the file to store the visualization (as an SVG image).

```
cd visualizer 
java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg [-X]
ls -lh sample.svg
```
To viualize the SVG file:

  - Open it with a web browser
  - Convert it into something else with tool slike `rsvg-convert`

### Debug Visualizer
In debug mode, it will visualize the polygon's segments and vertices as black, centroid as red and neighbouring relations as grey. Debug mode uses the flag `-X`
 ```
 java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg -X
 ```


## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.

## Backlog

### Definition of Done
A feature is determined as done if it succesfully accomplishes the minimum of the feature without affecting previous features implemented. It shoul not introduce no more than 30 minutes of technical debt. 

status:
Pending (P), Started (S), Blocked (B), Done (D)
